I have learned how to use the Unity engine to build interactive and visually engaging games. I became familiar with Unity’s interface, scene hierarchy, component system, prefabs, animations, and scripting with CSharp.
This helped me understand how to create and manage game objects, implement player controls, handle collisions, and design basic UI elements. Alongside learning the technical tools, I also gained insight into the overall game development process—starting from idea generation and prototyping, to level design, gameplay mechanics, and playtesting. This has given me a structured understanding of how games are conceptualized, built, and refined. Additionally, I have started learning about networking in multiplayer games. I now understand the difference between single-player and multiplayer architectures, particularly the client-server model where the server maintains the authoritative game state while clients communicate their actions. I’ve also been introduced to concepts like networked object spawning, data synchronization, RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls), and handling latency and security.
